Project 5 design notes

HTTP server design (Lindsay)

The Python standard library's http.server and http.client modules are used for serving and retrieving content from the origin server. When the server is started, it begins warming its cache using threaded execution so as not to block incoming requests. Since we know the popularity distribution of the content in advance and contents won't change, it makes sense to start prepping the cache as soon as possible.

We have a two-tiered cache: the most popular contents are stored in memory for fastest access, then the next most popular are stored on disk. We ship the latter in our deploy script so the server only needs to unzip it on startup, and to learn which pages it has on disk, it reads disk_cache.csv. (This file is a list of all the resources the disk_cache.zip file contains. We determined this list and the in-memory one using trial and error to find the most page contents we could store compressed while staying within our 20 MB disk and memory limits.) Next, memory_cache.csv is read into a queue with blocking functionality. We start working through this queue using 3 threads. Each thread takes an item off the queue, requests the content for that resource from the origin, and adds it to the in-memory cache. Threads exit when the queue is empty.

While the cache is being populated, the web server also starts up and accepts requests. Aside from the special /grading/beacon case, the server always checks for the request resource in its caches first. If the content is there, the server returns the cached content; if not, it requests the resource from the origin server and returns that.

Still to do: perform active measurement of client connection using scamper python tool, add endpoint for DNS server to get data about this measurement, and add a health check endpoint so the server can let the runCDN script know when it is ready to accept requests.

DNS server design(Tianyi )

dnslib is used to construct dns packet from the request. The dns server will be running at the cs5700cdnproject.ccs.neu.edu and on the specific port. The dns server can handle request by first
parsing it than construct reply based on the header file of the request. Then it will direct the request the the default replica server  50.116.41.109. \

Still to do: cache the client ip and response for future queries, implement the feature to find the cloestest replica using geolocation.
