Project 5 design notes

Official project guidelines: https://david.choffnes.com/classes/cs4700sp22/project5.php

Components
 - DNS redirection
    + based on geolocation at first (can use GeoIP database - need to sign up for license and install geoip2 client library?: https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolocate-an-ip/web-services?lang=en#official-api-clients)
    + later add active observation of request performance
    + also consider server load
    + also consider which server has data cached
    + if time, add passive observation?
    + maintain mapping of clients to replicas
    + can use dnslib (https://github.com/paulc/dnslib) to build/parse DNS response/request packets
 - web server
    X respond to request for '/grading/beacon' with 204 response code
    + get content from cache if it's there, from origin if not
    + maintain limited cache (20MB) based on popularity of content
    + measure latency with client (using scamper? https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/scamper/ -- python tools: https://github.com/cmand/scamper), share that info with DNS server over HTTP
 - scripts (use SSH key-based authentication)
    + deployCDN
    + runCDN
    + stopCDN
